Mental Wellness Reflection Bot 
so this is a mental wellness reflection chatbot i built for an ai/ml task.
it’s not meant to diagnose or give advice, just to listen, reflect what you’re feeling, and ask gentle follow-up questions.
basically a calm, non-judgy bot you can talk to.
what it does
you type how you’re feeling and the bot replies empathetically.
it reflects emotions instead of giving solutions. you can also paste an image link and it reflects on the mood of the image
i used python, flask, html, llm via openrouter and deployed on render.
